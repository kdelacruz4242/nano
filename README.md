Coffee Ordering and Inventory System
The JavaCoffee Co System utilizes many classes in order to make customizable coffee orders and it also intakes all of 
the possible ingredients to have an inventory system. An initial inventory is declared in the "Inventory.txt" file. and all 
orders will be logged in the "OrderLog.txt" file.
Files will work and run if they are in 1 project.
